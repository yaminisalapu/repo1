"1F data" most commonly refers to data in First Normal Form (1NF), a database rule requiring atomic (indivisible) values in each cell, consistent data types per column, and unique rows, essential for relational databases. It can also refer to specific technical or scientific datasets, like CYGNSS Level 1 Raw IF data (Intermediate Frequency) for Earth observation, or data related to device specs like ZKTeco 1F/1E
